/*note:
 when you access the _id field directly, it's represented as an instance of ObjectId, which has a toHexString() method for converting it to a hexadecimal string. However, when you assign _id to another field (such as id), Mongoose automatically converts it to a string representation, including the hexadecimal format, without the need to call toHexString() explicitly.
